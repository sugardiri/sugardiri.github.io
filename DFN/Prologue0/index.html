                    <p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!”<br><br>

                        ARA~! There it is again, another mommy’s scream. I can hear it, every day, all the time. I’m not sure what daddy’s doing in the other room. But it smells so rotten. <br><br>
                        
                        It’s so stinky and I feel the back of my throat try to control the urge to throw up. But I’m a good girl, so I keep my thoughts  inside my head. Just like daddy asked. I won’t question a single thing, because bad girls  get haunted by that scary voice. Bad girls are not me, I am good.<br><br>
                    
                        Unlike those baaaad mommies! I am good! <br><br>
                    
                    ……...Hmm...but I wonder….sometimes I hear laughter, sometimes I hear strange sounds I don’t understand.  I think daddy’s happy….? Is he playing with the mommies….?<br><br>
                    Should I be happy for him…..? I wonder what games they’re playing…?
                    ……………………….I want to know…….but I can’t see…..<br><br>
                    
                    What is daddy doing in the other room to the mommy?? Why is daddy always hiding from me…..? If I wasn’t blind…. would I understand? Why does he ignore me, to go play with those stup--nice mommies….? I wonder why? Is it because I’m broken….?<br><br>
                    
                              I’m broken, right……? …………………… No……………...<br><br>
                    Come to think about it…. daddy says I’m smarter than other girls, he says I’m special and that I’m gifted. I wonder what that means? Nyasha, do you think I’m special too...? <br><br>
                    
                    
                    
                    I hold my beloved Nyasha close to my chest and hear her cheerful voice giggle.<br><br>
                    
                    I want to giggle too, but I can’t. The stench of rotten meat is so strong that if I speak, I will lose control of myself and throw up my dinner.<br><br>
                    
                    Daddy doesn’t like that. He already struggles enough to find me food. If I lose my dinner, he will be mad and I will be bad. Bad girls don’t deserve to live. At least, that’s what I hear him say to those mommies.<br><br>
                    
                    Whatever that means. I think it's bad?<br><br>
                    
                    What does it mean to live?<br><br>
                    
                    Hey, Nyasha….<br><br>
                    
                    Nyasha…?<br><br>
                    
                    ………...<br><br>
                    
                        I heard you giggle, my Nyasha. You giggled because you know I’m special, right? I know I’m very special. That’s what daddy tells me, so it must be true. The absolute truth. Even if I can’t see, it doesn’t matter. That’s why you smile for me. That’s why you’re always close to me. That’s why you giggle and play for me…..That's Nyasha.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    But I’m tired of waiting….<br><br>
                    I want to know what daddy is doing. I want to know what he’s hiding from me. I want to know why this weird rotten smell daddy describes as blood makes me sick. <br><br>I just want to know, why would he rather play with those mommies than me? What do they have that I don’t? I thought I was special? I thought I was gifted? I thought I was -one of a kind-?
                    
                    I walk and I walk down the stinky hallway. Slowly, and steadily. Silently. I don’t want daddy to hear. I don’t want him to know that I’m sneaking in on him. I hold Nyasha close to my chest, as I always do. I want her as close to my heart as I can. <br><br>
                    
                    The closer I walk, the more I can hear it. The voice of the mommies screaming and the sound of my own daddy laughing. I’m so happy that he’s happy. I want to know why?
                    I want to join in on the fun. I want to be special, too. Not that I’m not already special.<br><br>
                    
                    *Creeeeeeek* I open the door, and I smile wide. I want to surprise my daddy with my presence. But oddly enough….<br><br>
                    Daddy is so entertained with the mommy, that he fails to notice me…
                    Feeling powerless, I just listen to daddy talking to the mommy….<br><br>
                    
                    
                       I can hear my daddy’s excited laughter echoing through the entire room and hallway. The stinky smell is stronger than my own room and I can hear what I think is the sound of rain dripping down from the ceiling. <br><br>
                    
                    
                    
                    Daddy: Oh, my beautiful Candelaria! I love you, my lady!<br><br>
                    
                    
                    -*COUGH* Y-you w-won’t g-get away with this, Marcello….- <br><br>
                    
                    Marcello: What are you talking about my lady? I already got what I wanted from you. Why don’t you just shut up and bleed more for me, hmmm~?<br><br>
                    
                    
                    -*COUGH* Y-you c-crazy b-bastard...- <br><br>
                    
                    Marcello: My lady! Hush! Corpses don’t speak!<br><br>
                    
                    
                    I hear my daddy grab something metallic from a table and next thing I know, I hear the sounds of flesh being stabbed, and bloody screams from this Candelaria mommy. <br><br>I think daddy grabbed a knife and it’s hurting her. Why is daddy doing that? Why is he laughing while he stabs her? I don’t understand. Is it that fun? To stab someone? Is it funny? <br><br>
                    
                    -Daddy…...?- <br><br>I call out to him and I hear daddy drop his knife. I take this opportunity to crawl towards that fun toy and grab it with my own hands. It’s kind of sticky, but that’s fine.  I smile once more, hoping that this time he’ll notice me.
                    -Daddy, I want to play with you too…?-<br><br>
                    
                    I’m so proud of myself. I finally told daddy. Now we can play.
                    
                    But it’s strange. He’s so quiet and I don’t understand why? I hear his footsteps get closer. He leans down and snatches the knife away from my hand and I hear a loud bang, almost as if his fist hit the wall beside me. Even then, he doesn’t speak to me. Why? Why don’t daddy talk to me!? W-why d-don’t he want to play!?<br><br>
                    
                    Marcello: *Sniff* D-don’t j-judge me, C-candy…<br><br>
                    
                    Candy:.........?<br><br>
                    
                    Marcello: *Sniff* D-damn it! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!<br><br>
                    
                    Candy: ...Daddy…?<br><br>
                    
                    Marcello: *Sniff* Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
                    
                     Before I can say anything else, I feel his hands gripping my neck. I kick my legs and flail my arms around, searching for Nyasha, my only saviour. But she’s not here. I’m burning up inside as I try to gasp for air and it hurts. I can’t breathe. <br><br>
                    
                    
                    ………………<br><br>
                    
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                     I’m not sure where I am, but my body hurts so bad and I hear a loud -beep beep- close to my head. It’s so annoying, but it doesn’t stink. There’s someone playing with my hair. That person has soft hands. They smell so nice. Like flowers? <br><br>
                    
                    I hear a woman’s voice whisper sweetly..<br><br>
                    
                    
                    
                    - Good morning, Candice. My name’s Maure Zuniga.-<br><br>
