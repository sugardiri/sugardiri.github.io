    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Early years, line-up changes, and Psalms (2010–2015)</h3>

    <p>The band's first EP entitled Triumph, released in 2010, carried a distinct metalcore sound, while occasionally bordering on deathcore. The band's second EP Bone Kingdom was the first to carry a deathcore sound, albeit a more straightforward sound reminiscent of bands such as Chelsea Grin and Oceano. The EP's second track, "Life of Fear", was used in a viral video titled "Heavy Metal Cats", which currently holds over 6 million views on YouTube.</p>

    <p>Maleficium, the band's third EP, was released in December 2013. It reached number 3 on the iTunes Metal Chart and was also released as a digipak CD making it the first non-digital Lorna Shore release. The band distances and disregards themselves from any releases prior to Maleficium and considers the EP the "rebirth and true starting point of their career." The band to this day still perform songs from the EP, and it's the earliest material that they will still willingly play live.</p>

    <p>Lorna Shore followed the release of Maleficium by opening Carnifex's Die Without Hope Tour featuring I Declare War, Betraying the Martyrs and Here Comes the Kraken.[3] Since then, before releasing their debut album they have toured with acts such as The Black Dahlia Murder, Archspire, Oceano, Fallujah, Fit for an Autopsy, Cattle Decapitation, Dying Fetus, Deicide, Upon a Burning Body, The Last Ten Seconds of Life, Chelsea Grin, and Within the Ruins.[4][5][6][7][8] Psalms, their debut album was released on June 9 through Density Records. The album was produced by Fit for an Autopsy guitarist Will Putney at The Machine Shop.[9]</p>

    <h3>Flesh Coffin and Herrera's departure (2016–2017)</h3>

    <p>On September 21, 2016, Lorna Shore announced that they had signed with Outerloop Records.[10] The band released their second studio album Flesh Coffin on February 17, 2017.[11] The album was produced by Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland at Atrium Audio, who are known for working alongside bands such as August Burns Red and From Ashes to New, among others.[12] They released a single entitled "Denounce the Light" on November 17, 2016.</p>

    <p>In early 2017, bassist and founding member Gary Herrera announced his departure from the band, citing his lack of desire and passion for the music as his main reasons. Flesh Coffin would subsequently be the last release to include Tom Barber on vocals as well as Gary Herrera (who was the only remaining founding member left) on bass.</p>

    <h3>Departure of Barber and Deffley, McCreery's allegations, and Immortal (2018–2020)</h3>

    <p>Longtime vocalist Tom Barber confirmed that he had left Lorna Shore in April 2018 to join Chelsea Grin as their vocalist, replacing Alex Koehler, who departed earlier in the year.[13] Lorna Shore issued a statement, assuring their fanbase that they would continue without Barber. CJ McCreery of Pittsburgh-based deathcore band Signs of the Swarm was subsequently announced as his replacement.[14] After McCreery joined Lorna Shore, the band released two singles, titled "This Is Hell" and "Darkest Spawn". The band joined the Summer Slaughter Tour supporting Cattle Decapitation, Carnifex, The Faceless, and several others.[15] In early October, Lorna Shore announced their signing with Century Media Records along with the announcement of their new album, Immortal.[16] The band supported Fit for an Autopsy and Rivers of Nihil from October to November.[17]</p>

    <p>On December 23, 2019, the band abruptly fired McCreery after a Weinstein effect-style string of allegations involving alleged sexual abuse occurred in his name.[18] The allegations began when an ex-lover of McCreery began posting stories and screenshots of text messages detailing abusive-like behavior that allegedly occurred within a 4-year relationship. Following this some other parties also began to accuse McCreery of similar misconduct.[19] A week and a half later, the band announced the cancellation of an upcoming tour in Asia and that their upcoming Immortal album (which was developed with McCreery on vocals) would be delayed.[20][21] However, these claims were later retracted as it was revealed some time later that the album would be released on the originally planned date of January 31.[22]

    <h3>...And I Return to Nothingness and Pain Remains (2021–present)</h3>


    <p>Despite the situation, Lorna Shore went on to tour Europe in support of Immortal, recruiting vocalist Will Ramos (formerly of Monument of a Memory and A Wake in Providence) as a stand-in.[23] All further activity was cut short as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 5, 2021, while on tour, the band released an instrumental edition of Immortal.[24]</p>


    <p>On June 11, 2021, the band returned with a new song titled "To the Hellfire", and announced Ramos as their new permanent vocalist. They also announced details of their new EP ...And I Return to Nothingness.[25] It is the band's first EP since their breakthrough 2013 release Maleficium.</p>

    <p>"To the Hellfire" became a viral success for the band, peaking at number 1 on the iTunes metal chart in its first week of release. It was also voted by the readers of Revolver as the "Best Song of 2021 So Far" with writer Eli Enis calling it "one of the most over-the-top heavy deathcore songs in recent memory.[26] It would also go on to overtake "Immortal" as the band's most streamed song on Spotify at over 4 million streams. It was elected by Loudwire as the best metal song of 2021.[27]</p>

    <p>The EP was released on August 13, 2021 with positive reviews for the title track. Ricky Aarons writing for Wall of Sound reviewed the EP and title track stating: "The band continue with the epic vehicle of destruction, but change tact slightly, in a way that's reminiscent of their previous work... The technical detail and speed to the riffs are incredible. Once again Ramos doesn't skip a detail in every lyric he sounds... He considers which lines end in a high or low and these minute details are make-or-break. Instead of the song focusing on breakdown ferocity it's more about stead-fast blast beats and the technical element of this wonderful band."[28]</p>


    <p>On April 29, 2022, the band debuted a new song, "Sun//Eater", during a concert from their upcoming full length album, titled Pain Remains. The song, along with a music video, was officially released on May 13.[29] As well as the album announcement, the new single was the first to feature new bassist Michael Yager, who joined the band during the recording sessions for Pain Remains. On June 22, Lorna Shore debuted their second single from their upcoming album titled "Into the Earth" with an accompanying music video.[30] On July 26, the band released the third single from the album, "Cursed to Die", and also revealed Pain Remains would be released on October 14.[31] On September 14, the band released the first part of the album's title track titled "Pain Remains I: Dancing Like Flames".[32] On September 29, the band released the second part of the album's title track titled "Pain Remains II: After All I've Done, I'll Disappear" along with a music video.[33]</p>
