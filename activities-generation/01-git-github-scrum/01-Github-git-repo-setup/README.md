## For this activity your goal is to...
1A. go to https://www.github.com/new
1B. Create new github repo, make it public and add a README.md (do this on github, DO NOT use the "git init" command)
2. Cloning the repo to your computer. Use the green "Code" button in your repository, select HTTPS, then copy the url, go to your command line and use the following command `git clone repo_url`
3. Add a file or open up the readme and make a change, so that your repo has a modified status.
4. Pushing your code back to github.
    - `git status` to check your working directory
    - `git add .` or `git add file_name` to stage your changes
    - `git commit -m "some message about what you did"` to commit those changes creating a version of your code.
    - `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository
5. After you push your changes, go to the repository on github and confirm that you have a new file or see the change to "README.md".
