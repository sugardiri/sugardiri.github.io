## Using Google Fonts

# Start by: (It is always recommended to create a branch for each activity that we do, this way you can keep your main branch clean)
- Create a new branch for this activity:
    - git checkout -b 02-google-fonts 
- When you finish the activity make sure to "add" your changes and "commit" them:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "finished activity"
- Then return to the main branch:
    - git checkout main

## Walk-through

    - create an html and css document inside of the google-fonts folder.
    - make sure to link your files and then check them in the browser to ensure they are connected properly (you will need to add some sort of styling for this part).
    - in your html file create an `<h1>` and a `<p>` tag and give them some content.
    - Find 2 fonts from https://fonts.google.com/ , one will be used for the "h1" and the other for the "p" tag.
    - Use the `<link>` method for one of the fonts in your html file and the `@import` method for the other font in your css file.
    - make sure you also set the `font-family` property for each element to the font that you have chosen.
    - once you are all done, make sure to add and commit your changes before moving back to the main branch.
