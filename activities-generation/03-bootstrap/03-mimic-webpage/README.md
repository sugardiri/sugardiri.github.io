- Make sure to start by creating a new branch for this activity

- Your task is to look at the following images and re-create the website. You do not have to have the exact images, but try to mimic the layout and colors as best as possible.

- You will have 30 minutes to work on each step by yourself, and then an instructor will build it with you and share out the code so you can continue to the next step.
